    content: 'This section will help save you time when learning and help you improve your marks.\n\nSteps\n1. Test\n2. Operate\n3. Test\n4. Exit\n\n1. Test\nThe very first step you should take when revising and preparing for a test/exam is to test yourself or get a friend/family member or even an AI to test you on the section you need to know. Once you have answered the question/self-test, check to see which answers you got right and which ones you got wrong.\n\nIf, for example, you achieved 60%, it means that you still need to work on the 40% you don\'t know yet. No need to go over the 60% you do know, because you know it. Only spend time on the parts you don\'t know. This will save you a lot of time.\n\n2. Operate\nSo now that you have identified to areas that need attention, do the following:\n\na. Write in your beliefs journal to boost your beliefs in your ability to master this section.\nb. Virtual Read all the information you don\'t know.\nc. Do the Understanding Strategy to all words/terms/symbols, etc that you don\'t fully understand.\n\n3. Test\nOnce you have applied all the strategies to the work you didn\'t know, Test yourself again on that section. This testing process is exactly the same as the first one. You should be tested on the work you have just learnt to once again establish what you do and don\'t know. If you achieve 80% for this test, then operate again on the section you got wrong.\n\nYou should continue operating and testing yourself until you achieve 100%. Only once you have achieved 100% should move onto the next step, which is exit.\n\n4. Exit\nHere you will exit what you have just learnt and move onto the next section. If you revise this way daily, you will be repeating known information through being tested and come to know the work you didn\'t know before. This will greatly improve your memory of the work and effectively prepare you for tests and exams. It is important that you acquire the habit of revising daily and this way avoid a situation where you have an overwhelming amount of unknown work to learn just before the exams.\n\n5. Conclusion\n\nRevising is absolutely necessary to impact long-term memory and to effectively prepare for tests and exams. When you consistently revise, you will become increasing confident about writing tests and exams, and you will develop an empowering belief system about your ability to achieve.',
