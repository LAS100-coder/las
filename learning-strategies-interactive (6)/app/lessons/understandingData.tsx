    content: '1. Identify the word/term/symbol/abbreviation you do not fully understand\na. You need to increase your awareness of words and their meanings. If you assume you know what a word means, you won\'t recognise why you don\'t understand the communication. For example, if you assume that "feline" means a member of the dog family, you may think that you understand the sentence and may get frustrated when the answer is incorrect.\n\nThe first step in gaining this awareness is for you to check/test your understanding. Ask the person who is giving you the information if you understand them correctly by you explaining the information back to them.\n\nb. Sometimes you will have some level of understanding of what is meant. Perhaps it may not be specific enough. If you find yourself saying, "I know what it means, but I can\'t explain it", then they do not fully understand what the words mean. For example, when you write or do a test/exam, you need to express the ideas and concepts you have learnt in a way that the examiner/listener finds acceptable. If you can\'t explain what the words mean and give an example, you can do the following:\n\n2. Get the meaning/definition for the word/term/symbol/abbreviation in context.\na. There are many resources today that can easily help you get the meaning. You could ask someone, use AI, look on the internet, etc. It is important to get the meaning that meets the situation. If you are studying maths, get the mathematical meaning for the word. Each subject has its own vocabulary for example, the word "register" has several meanings. (1. Cash register. 2. Class register to record student attendance. 3. To sign up for a course. 4. Informal and formal register would be the language that is used when addressing a particular audience. 5. To understand what is being said.\n\nb. If you get the meaning of the word and you find you still don\'t understand, it may be because there are words in the meaning/definition that you do not understand. When this happens, they will need to identify the words in the meaning you do not fully understand and get their meaning/definitions. You may feel frustrated if this happens a lot and there seem to be so many words you need to look up. Unfortunately, there is no way around this. If your vocabulary and understanding are not up to standard in a subject, the understanding strategy will help you become an expert.\n\nc. The understanding strategy requires a great deal of work from you. On the positive side, each word you learn is one word less that you need to learn in the future – and there are only so many words you need to know. As you become skilled with the eight steps of the understanding strategy, you will be able to learn a new word much quicker.\n\nd. When you have a healthy vocabulary in a subject, you will be able to understand your teachers/lecturers more effectively. You will understand notes, exam questions and you will be able to express yourself more effectively. The benefits are really very big. They are actually exponential.',

    content: '3. Create an example for the definition\na. Identifying the word and getting the meaning is where most people will stop. By completing the following steps, you will increase your ability to fully conceptualise the meaning and commit the word and its meaning to your long-term memory, and be able to spell the word and pronounce the word well.\n\nb. Real learning happens through examples. When babies first learn to do anything, they are watching, listening and experiencing people and situations around them. They figure out how to walk because everybody else is doing it. They learn to talk, because everybody else is doing it. The best teachers use examples their students can relate to and that make the concepts they are learning memorable.\n\nc. It is very important that you can learn from anyone and that you have the ability to create examples yourself. This way you become an expert in learning.\n\nd. When creating examples for definitions, it is useful to make general words specific. For example, the definition for "Feline" is "a member of the cat family". This definition does not provide an example, so you need to create one. You could picture a lion, a tiger, a house cat or even Garfield. You are free to choose whatever example interests you the most.\n\n4. Picture the example in your mind\na. The following steps are to ensure that you are using your senses (mind) effectively. With this step, you should see the example in your mind. When you are seeing/visualising the example, you are truly conceptualising the meaning. For example, you can picture a beautiful friendly full-grown tiger lying on your bed.\n\n5. Add sounds to the example\na. If the example has no sounds attached to it, it would be like watching a movie with the sound switched off. Adding sounds to the example helps make the example more interesting and memorable. For example, you could imagine the tiger lying on your bed and as you walk into your room, the tiger roars at you because it is happy to see you.\n\n6. Add strong emotions to the example\na. Memory is based on strong emotions. If you think back and you remember certain experiences you had, you would remember those experiences because of the emotional impact those experiences had on you. Long-term memory occurs due to emotional impact. If you add strong emotions to the example, the example will become memorable and you will remember what the words mean.\nb. The stronger the emotions in the example, the longer the memory. Any emotion will do as long as it is strong. For example, if you could be really happy and love seeing your pet tiger. Remember you can create whatever example you want. The tiger is just my example.\n\n7. See the word in the example.\na. If you see the word "feline" in the example you will also be able to spell the word correctly. For example, you could imagine the tiger with a necklace and on the necklace is the word "feline." It also ties the word to its meaning, so when they see the word "feline" written somewhere, the whole example comes to mind automatically.\n\n8. Hear the word in the example.\na. You should hear the word being pronounced correctly in the example. This will enable you to recognise the word when it is being used by others and it will also enable you to say the word properly.\n\nb. When you attach the pronunciation of the word in the example, the example will come to mind when you hear the word being used by others and they will be able to conceptualise what is being said.',

    content: '• When you have an extended vocabulary, you will understand things a lot easier.\n• When you understand, it is a lot easier to concentrate.\n• It is also easier to become interested in a subject and the more interested you are, the better you will do.\n• The more words you learn using the understanding strategy, the more accurate your spelling will be and you will pronounce words more effectively.\n\nSummary of the steps\n\n1. Identify the word/term/symbol/abbreviation you do not fully understand.\n2. Obtain the meaning/definition for the word/term/symbol/abbreviation in context.\n3. Create an example for the definition.\n4. Picture the example in your mind.\n5. Add sounds to the example.\n6. Add strong emotions to the example.\n7. See the word in the example.\n8. Hear the word in the example.\n\nPractice makes perfect. The more you practice the steps, the easier they will become and eventually you will do them automatically, without needing to think about them.',
